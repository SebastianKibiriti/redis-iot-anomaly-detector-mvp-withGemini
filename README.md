Redis-Powered IoT Anomaly DetectorThis project demonstrates a robust, real-time data processing pipeline for an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor using Redis Streams and Redis Time Series. It's designed to ingest a stream of sensor data, detect anomalies, store the data efficiently for historical analysis, and alert a separate service to critical eventsâ€”all in real time.ArchitectureThe system is built on a a microservices architecture, with each component performing a single, well-defined function. Redis serves as the central hub for all data communication and storage, providing a durable, high-performance foundation.The data flow is as follows:+-----------------+     +--------------------------+     +--------------------+
| producer.py     | --> | Redis Stream (raw_data)  | --> | stream_processor.py|

FeaturesReal-time Data Ingestion: Uses Redis Streams as a durable message queue for a continuous flow of sensor data.Robust Stream Processing: The stream_processor uses Redis Consumer Groups to ensure no data is lost, even if the processor crashes and restarts.Anomaly Detection: A simple, threshold-based logic in the stream_processor identifies and flags anomalous temperature readings.Decoupled Alerting System: Anomalies are published to a separate Redis Stream, allowing an independent alert_consumer to process them.Time-Series Data Archiving: The raw sensor data is stored in Redis Time Series keys for efficient historical analysis and visualization.Live Dashboard: A simple web-based dashboard provides a live, interactive view of the sensor's temperature data.Getting StartedPrerequisitesDocker and Docker Compose: To run the Redis Stack server.Python 3.8+: The runtime environment for all scripts.pip: Python's package installer.Python Libraries:redisFlaskredis-py-clusterredistimeseriesSetupClone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/redis-iot-anomaly-detector-mvp-withGemini.git
cd redis-iot-anomaly-detector-mvp-withGemini
Start Redis with Docker Compose:docker compose up -d
This will start a Redis Stack container and expose the necessary ports.Create a Python Virtual Environment:python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1  # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate    # On macOS/Linux
Install Dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run the ApplicationThe application consists of four independent scripts that must be run concurrently in four separate terminals.Terminal 1: Data Producerpython producer.py
Terminal 2: Stream Processorpython stream_processor.py
Terminal 3: Alert Consumerpython alert_consumer.py
Terminal 4: Web Dashboardpython dashboard.py
Once the dashboard is running, you can access it at http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
